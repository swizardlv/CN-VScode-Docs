# Visual Studio Code 基础

从骨子里来说，Visual Studio Code 是一款代码编辑器. 跟其它的代码编辑器一样, VS Code 吸取了通用的用户接口和布局：左侧是用于展示所要编辑的所有文件和文件夹的文件管理器，右侧是打开文件的编辑区域。

另外，在VS Code当中还有一些与众不同的特性。在这个主题内将重点描述这些特性。


## 文件（File）, 文件夹（Folders） & 工程（Projects）

VS Code 是基于文件和文件夹的 - 可以在 VS Code中通过打开文件和文件夹立即开始使用.

在这上面，VS Code 可以读取并自用一系列的不同框架和平台定义的工程文件。例如，如果你在VS Code中打开的文件夹中包含一个或多个'package.json'，'project.json'，'tsconfig.json' 亦或者 ASP.net core Visual Studio 解决方案和工程文件，VS Code 将读取这些文件并且利用它们来提供额外的功能，如在编辑器中的丰富的智能感知（IntelliSense）功能。

## 基本布局

VS Code 给我们带来一种简单直观的外观布局，这种布局可以给编辑器提供最大的空间同时又给浏览访问目录或工程上下文提供了充足的空间。整体UI被分成了四个区域：
* **Editor** 用来编辑文件的主体区域。可以并排打开三个编辑器。
* **Side Bar** 包含不同的像浏览器一样的视图来协助来完成工程。
* **Status Bar** 展示当前打开的工程和正在编辑的文件的信息。
* **View Bar** 在最左手边，帮助切换视图以及提供额外的上下文相关的提示，比如激活了Git的情况下，需要提交的变化的数目。

每次打开VS Code的时候，都会回到上一次关闭时的状态。文件夹，布局以及打开的文件都会保存。

![VS Code 布局](images/codebasics/layout.png)

Instead of placing files in separate tabs, VS Code allows up to three visible editors at any one time, allowing you place up to three files together side by side.

This helps to reduce the overhead of managing tabs but does not restrict the number of files you can work with. The Explorer view maintains a list of working files allowing you quick access to the files you need.

>**小技巧：** You can move the Side Bar to the right hand side (**View** > **Move Sidebar**) or toggle its visibility (`kb(workbench.action.toggleSidebarVisibility)`).

## 并列编辑

可以最多并排打开三个编辑器.

If you already have one editor open, there are multiple ways of opening another editor to the side of the existing one:

* `kbstyle(Ctrl)` (Mac: `kbstyle('Cmd')`) click on a file in the Explorer
* `kb(workbench.action.splitEditor)` to split the active editor into two
* **Open to the Side** from the Explorer context menu on a file

![Side by Side editing](images/codebasics/sidebyside.png)

Whenever you open another file, the editor that is active will display the content of that file. So if you have two editors side by side and you want to open file 'foo.cs' into the right hand editor, make sure that editor is active (by clicking inside it) before opening file 'foo.cs'.

When you have more than one editor open you can switch between them quickly by holding the `kbstyle(Ctrl)` (Mac: `kbstyle('Cmd')`) key and pressing `kbstyle(1)`, `kbstyle(2)`, or `kbstyle(3)`.

>**小技巧：** You can resize editors and reorder them. Drag and drop the editor title area to reposition or resize the editor.

## 文件管理器（Explorer）

文件管理器用来浏览，打开和管理项目中的所有的文件和目录。

当在VS Code当中打开一个目录，目录中所有的内容都会显示在文件管理器当中。在这里可以进行很多操作：

* 创建，删除以及重命名文件和目录
* 通过拖拽的形式移动文件和目录
* 用上下文菜单来浏览所有的选项

>**小技巧：** 可以从VS Code拖拽文件到文件管理器来实现文件的复制

![文件管理器菜单](images/codebasics/explorer_menu.png)

VS Code works very well with other tools that you might use, especially command line tools. If you want to run a command line tool in the context of the folder you currently have open in VS Code, right-click the folder and select **Open in Command Prompt** (or **Open in Terminal** on OS X or Linux).

You can also navigate to the location of a file or folder in the native Explorer by right-clicking on a file or folder and selecting **Reveal in Explorer** (or **Reveal in Finder** on the Mac or **Open Containing Folder** on Linux).

>**小技巧：** Type `kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)` (**Quick Open**) to quickly search and open a file by its name.

By default, VS Code excludes some folders from the explorer (for example. `.git`). Use the `files.exclude` [setting](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md) to configure rules for hiding files and folders from the explorer.

**小技巧：** This is really useful to hide derived resources files, like `\*.meta` in Unity, or `\*.js` in a TypeScript project. For Unity to exclude the `\*.cs.meta` files, the pattern to choose would be: `"**/*.cs.meta": true`. For TypeScript, you can exclude generated JavaScript for TypeScript files with: `"**/*.js": {"when": "$(basename).ts"}`.

## Working Files

At the top of the Explorer is a section labeled **WORKING FILES**. This is a list of active files. These are files you previously opened in VS Code that you're working on. For example, a file will be listed in the working files section if you:

* make a change to a file
* double-click a file in the Explorer
* open a file that is not part of the current folder

![Working Files Section](images/codebasics/workingfiles.png)

Think of the **WORKING FILES** section as similar to Tabs that you may be familiar with in other code editors or IDEs. Just click a file in the working files section, and it becomes active in VS Code.

Once you are done with your task, you can individually remove files from the working files section, or you can remove all files from the working files section by using the **Close All Files** action.

>**小技巧：** You can type `kb(workbench.files.action.workingFilesPicker)` to navigate the list of working files from file picker without having the explorer visible.

## Configuring the Editor

VS Code gives you many options to configure the editor. You can set options globally through user settings or per project/folder through workspace settings. Settings values are kept in a `settings.json` [file](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md#settings-file-locations).

* Select **Files** > **Preferences** > **User Settings** (or press `kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`, type `user` and press `Enter`) to edit the user settings.json file.

* Select **Files** > **Preferences** > **Workspace Settings** (or press `kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`, type `worksp` and press `Enter`) to edit the workspace settings.json file.

You will see the VS Code [Default Settings](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md#default-settings) in the left window and your editable `settings.json` on the right. You can easily review and copy settings from Default Settings.

After editing your settings, type `kb(workbench.action.files.save)` to save your changes. The changes will take effect immediately.

## Save/Auto Save

By default, VS Code requires an explicit action to save your changes to disk, `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

However, it's easy to turn on `Auto Save`, which will save your changes after a configured delay or when focus leaves the editor. With this option turned on, there is no need to explicitly save the file.

To configure `Auto Save`, open **User Settings** or **Workspace Settings** and find the associated settings:

* `files.autoSave`: Can have the values `off` to disable auto save, `afterDelay` to save files after a configured delay and `onFocusChange` to save files when focus moves out of the editor of the dirty file.
* `files.autoSaveDelay`: Configures the delay in milliseconds when `files.autoSave` is configured to `afterDelay`.

## Search Across Files

VS Code allows you to quickly search over all files in the currently-opened folder.  Simply type `kb(workbench.view.search)` and type in your search. Search results are grouped into files containing the search term, with an indication of the hits in each file and its location. Expand a file to see a preview of all of the hits within that file. Then single-click on one of the hits to view it in the editor.

![A simple text search across files](images/codebasics/search.png)

>**小技巧：** We support regular expression searching in the search box, too.

You can configure advanced search options by typing `kb(workbench.action.search.toggleQueryDetails)`. This will show additional fields to configure the search.

![Advanced search options](images/codebasics/searchadvanced.png)

In the two input boxes below the search box, you can include and exclude files. Click on the toggle to the right to enable the glob pattern syntax:

* `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment
* `?` to match on one character in a path segment
* `**` to match any number of path segments, including none
* `{}` to group conditions (e.g. `{**/*.html,**/*.txt}` matches all HTML and text files)
* `[]` to declare a range of characters to match (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)

VS Code excludes some folders by default to reduce the number of search results that you are not interested in (for example: `node_modules`). Open settings to change these rules under the `files.exclude` and `search.exclude` section.

>**小技巧：** From the Explorer you can right-click on a folder and select **Find in Folder** to search inside a folder only.

## 命令面板（Command Palette）

VS Code is equally accessible from the keyboard. The most important key combination to know is `kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`, which brings up the **Command Palette**. From here, you have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.

![Command Palette](images/codebasics/commands.png)

The Command Palette provides access to many commands. You can execute editor commands, open files, search for symbols, and see a quick outline of a file, all using the same interactive window. Here are a few tips:

* `kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)` will let you navigate to any file or symbol by simply typing its name
* `kb(workbench.action.openPreviousEditor)` will cycle you through the last set of files opened
* `kb(workbench.action.showCommands)` will bring you directly to the editor commands
* `kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)` will let you navigate to a specific symbol in a file
* `kb(workbench.action.gotoLine)` will let you navigate to a specific line in a file

Type `?` into the input field to get a list of available commands you can execute from here:

![Quick Open Help](images/codebasics/quickopenhelp.png)

## 快速文件导航

The Explorer is great for navigating between files when you are exploring a project. However, when you are working on a task, you will find yourself quickly jumping between the same set of files. VS Code provides two powerful commands to navigate in and across files with easy-to-use key bindings.

Hold `kbstyle(Ctrl)` and press `kbstyle(Tab)` to view a list of all files that have been opened since VS Code was launched. To open one of these files, use `kbstyle(Tab)` again to pick the file you want to navigate to, then release `kbstyle(Ctrl)` to open it.

![Quick Navigation](images/codebasics/quicknav.png)

Alternatively, you can use `kb(workbench.action.navigateBack)` and `kb(workbench.action.navigateForward)` to navigate between files and edit locations. If you are jumping around between different lines of the same file, these shortcuts allow you to navigate between those locations easily.

>**小技巧:** You can open any file by its name when you type `kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)` (**Quick Open**).

## 文件编码支持

Set the file encoding globally or per workspace by using the `files.encoding` setting in **User Settings** or **Workspace Settings**.

![files.encoding setting](images/codebasics/filesencodingsetting.png)


You can view the file encoding in the status bar.

![Encoding in status bar](images/codebasics/fileencoding.png)

Click on the encoding in the status bar to reopen or save the active file with a different encoding.

![Reopen or save with a different encoding](images/codebasics/encodingclicked.png)

Then choose an encoding.

![Select an encoding](images/codebasics/encodingselection.png)

## Launching from the Command Line

You can launch VS Code from the command line to quickly open a file, folder, or project. Typically, you open VS Code within the context of a folder. We find the best way to do this is to simply type:

```
code .
```

>**小技巧：** We have instructions for Mac users in our [Setup](/docs/editor/setup.md#_mac-os-x) topic that enable you to start VS Code from within a terminal.  We add the VS Code executable to the `PATH` environment variable in Windows and Linux automatically.

Sometimes you will want to open or create a file. If a file does not exist, we will create it for you:

```
code index.html style.css readme.md
```

>**小技巧：** 可以通过空格来区分多个文件名。


## 额外的命令行参数

在命令行中通过'code'来启动VS Code的时候有一些额外的命令行参数：

参数|描述
------------------|-----------
`-h` or `--help` | 打印说明
`-v` or `--version` | 打印 VS Code 版本 (例如 0.10.10)
`-n` or `--new-window`| Opens a new session of VS Code instead of restoring the previous session.
`-r` or `--reuse-window` | Forces opening a file or folder in the last active window.
`-g` or `--goto` | When used with *file:line:column?*, opens a file at a specific line and optional column position. This argument is provided since some operating systems permit `:` in a file name.
*file* | Name of a file to open. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created and marked as edited. You can specify multiple files by separating each file name with a space.
*file:line:column?* | Name of a file to open at the specified line and optional column position. You can specify multiple files in this manner, but you must use the `-g` argument (once) before using the *file:line:column?* specifier.
*folder* | Name of a folder to open. You can specify multiple folders.
`-d` or `--diff` | Open a file difference editor. Requires two file paths as arguments.
`--locale` | Set the display language (locale) for the VS Code session.  Supported locales are: `en-US`, `zh-TW`, `zh-CN`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `ru`, `es`
`--disable-extensions` | Disable all installed extensions. Extensions will still be visible in the `Extensions: Show Installed Extensions` dropdown but they will never be activated.
`-w` or `--wait` | Wait for the window to be closed before returning

For both files and folders, you can use absolute or relative paths. Relative paths are relative to the current directory of the command prompt where you run `code`.

If you specify more than one file or folder at the command line, VS Code will open only a single instance.

## 打开工程

VS Code does not distinguish between opening a folder and opening a project. If VS Code detects a project in the folder you opened (for example, a C# project), that project context will be displayed on the Status Bar. If more than one project is found, you can switch projects from there as well.

To open a project contained in the folder `C:\src\WebApp`, you would start VS Code like this:

````
code C:\src\webapp
````

After VS Code opens, just open source files and use the Status Bar to switch the active project as needed.

![Status Bar](images/codebasics/status.png)

## 管口管理

VS Code has some options to control how windows should be opened or restored between sessions.

The `window.openFilesInNewWindow` setting controls if files should open in a new window instead of reusing an existing VS Code instance. By default, VS Code will open a new window when you double-click on a file outside VS Code or open a file from the command line. Set this to `false` to reuse the last active instance of VS Code and open files in there.

The `window.reopenFolders` setting tells VS Code how to restore the opened windows of your previous session. By default, VS Code will
reopen the last opened folder you worked on (setting: `one`). Change this setting to `none` to never reopen any folders and always start with an empty VS Code instance. Change it to `all` to restore all folders you worked on during your previous session.

## 常见问题

**Q: Is it possible to globally search and replace?**

**A:** This feature is not yet implemented, but you can expect it to come in the future!

**Q: How do I turn on word wrap?**

**A:** You can control word wrap through the `editor.wrappingColumn` [setting](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md).  By default `editor.wrapperingColumn` is set to 300 characters.  You can adjust the column width or set the value to zero to wrap on the editor viewport width:

```json
    "editor.wrappingColumn": 0
```

You can toggle word wrap for the VS Code session with `kb(editor.action.toggleWordWrap)`.  Restarting VS Code will pick up the persisted `editor.wrappingColumn` value.

You can also add vertical column rulers to the editor with the `editor.rulers` setting which takes an array of column character positions where you'd like vertical rulers.

**Q: How can I show more files in the WORKING FILES section?**

**A:** You can configure the appearance of **WORKING FILES** through your [settings](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md). For example, you can set the maximum number of visible files before a scroll bar appears via the `explorer.workingFiles.maxVisible` setting and whether the **WORKING FILES** section should dynamically set its height via `explorer.workingFiles.dynamicHeight`.
